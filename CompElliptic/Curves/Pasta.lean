# The Pasta curves as short-Weierstrass elliptic curves

Concrete `SWCurve` instances for Pallas (`y² = x³ + 5` over the Pallas base field) — Vesta is
identical over the Vesta base field and is a TODO. Plus the curve-specific facts the `(0, 0) ≡ 𝒪`
representation relies on (`five_not_isSquare` ⟹ `no_onCurve_x_zero`, spec §5.4.9.7) and
`native_decide` sanity checks exercising the raw computable kernel.

Sanity checks use `native_decide` (compiler-trusted): they exercise the *definitions*
computationally and are independent of the soundness theorems to come.

/-- Pallas: `y² = x³ + 5` over the Pallas base field (`A = 0`, `B = 5`). -/
def a : PallasBaseField := 0
def b : PallasBaseField := 5

/-- A convenient prime-order point `(-1, 2)` for testing (just a test point, not a
protocol-specified base). -/
def G : PallasBaseField × PallasBaseField := (-1, 2)

theorem b_ne_zero : b ≠ 0 := by decide

/-- The Pallas curve as a rich `SWCurve`: ellipticity (`sw_Δ 0 5 = -10800 ≠ 0`, so `IsUnit`) and
`B ≠ 0` discharged by computation. -/
def curve : SWCurve PallasBaseField where
  A := a
  B := b
  IsElliptic := by rw [isUnit_iff_ne_zero]; native_decide
  B_nonzero := b_ne_zero

/-- The `(0, 0)` sentinel is off the Pallas curve. -/
theorem not_onCurve_zero : ¬ OnCurve a b (0, 0) :=
  CurveForms.ShortWeierstrass.not_onCurve_zero b_ne_zero

/-- `5` is a quadratic non-residue in the Pallas base field, so `y² = x³ + 5` has no point with
`x = 0` — the property the `(0,0) ≡ 𝒪` representation relies on (Zcash protocol spec §5.4.9.7).

True: Euler's criterion gives `5 ^ ((p-1)/2) = -1` (confirmed by PARI/GP and by this field's own
Pratt-cert `≠ 1` leg). The proof is `sorry` pending mechanization — plain `reduce_mod_char`
reduces that power inside the `PrattPartList.prime` legs but not in a standalone lemma here
(`decide` then hits `maxRecDepth`), and the Mathlib quadratic-residue lemma name still needs
pinning down (`ZMod.euler_criterion` was wrong). See `TODO.md`. -/
theorem five_not_isSquare : ¬ IsSquare (5 : PallasBaseField) := by
  sorry

/-- Consequently no point on the Pallas curve has `x`-coordinate `0`, so `x = 0` denotes `𝒪`
unambiguously. Proved from `five_not_isSquare` (so it inherits only that one `sorry`). -/
theorem no_onCurve_x_zero (y : PallasBaseField) : ¬ OnCurve a b (0, y) := by
  intro h
  have h' : y ^ 2 = 5 := by simpa [OnCurve, a, b] using h
  exact five_not_isSquare ⟨y, by rw [← h', pow_two]⟩

-- `(-1, 2)` is on the curve: `2² = 4 = (-1)³ + 5`.
example : OnCurve a b G := by native_decide

-- `G + (-G) = 𝒪` (hits the `q = -p` branch; no inversion).
example : add a G (neg G) = (0, 0) := by native_decide

-- `G + 𝒪 = G`.
example : add a G (0, 0) = G := by native_decide

-- Doubling and tripling stay on the curve (exercises the slope/inverse).
example : OnCurve a b (smul a 2 G) := by native_decide
example : OnCurve a b (smul a 3 G) := by native_decide
