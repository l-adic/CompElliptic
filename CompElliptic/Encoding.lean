# Encodings

An *encoding* maps an element type `G` into a type `D` of *depictions* — possible encoded forms
of elements that may or may not be decodable. `D` will typically be `BitVec ℓ`, a byte vector, etc.
We coin the term "depiction" to avoid confusion between encodings (the mappings) and depictions
(the encoded forms). `encode : G → D` is total and injective; `decode : D → Option G` is *partial*.

There are two encoding types, explicitly-named siblings so the choice between them is always
deliberate:

- `CanonicalEncoding G D` — the everyday type. `decode` is *canonical*: it accepts only canonical
  depictions (`IsCanonical`).
- `LenientEncoding G D` — `encode` / `decode` / `encodek` with *no* canonicity requirement, so
  `decode` may accept non-canonical depictions.

`EncodingClass` is the shared interface (`encode` / `decode` / `encodek`); both structures are
instances, so the tagged-depiction types below apply to either with prefix syntax.

In Zcash, for example, the encodings (see
[Zcash Protocol Specification §5.4.9](https://zips.z.cash/protocol/protocol.pdf#concretepairing))
of Pallas and Vesta curve points are canonical; the encodings of Jubjub curve points were
originally lenient, but additional canonicity checks were specified in [ZIP 216](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0216)
(actually the history is more complicated). To faithfully model situations like this, we
need both kinds of encoding.

## Two notions of validity

For any encoding `e`, a depiction can be:

- **decodable** — `(decode e r).isSome` (`decodableSet`); decoding yields some element.
- **canonical** — `r ∈ Set.range (encode e)` (`canonicalSet`); `r` is `encode g`, i.e. it decodes
  *and* round-trips.

`canonical ⊆ decodable` always holds; the notions coincide when `e` is a canonical encoding
(`CanonicalEncoding.canonicalSet_eq_decodableSet`). For lenient encodings they differ, and
—since conflating them is a common class of mistake— the API never says "valid": you must
name `Canonical` or `Decodable`.

## Tagged-depiction types

These types support local reasoning by allowing a depiction to be *tagged* with its intended
encoding, and whether it has been checked as decodable or canonical:

- `Raw e` — an unchecked depiction of `G` under `e`. This is type-distinct from a bare `D`,
  or a depiction for a different encoding.
- `Decodable e` — a depiction of `G` that is guaranteed to be decodable under `e`.
- `Canonical e` — a depiction of `G` that is guaranteed to be canonical under `e`.

`Canonical.decoded` and `Decodable.decoded` are total: they always return an element.

`encodingEquiv e : G ≃ Canonical e` gives the bijection between elements and their canonical
depictions.

A raw depiction can be validated using `checkCanonical : Raw e → Option (Canonical e)` or
`checkDecodable : Raw e → Option (Decodable e)`. A decodable depiction can be checked to be
already canonical (`Decodable.checkCanonical`) or canonicalized (`Decodable.canonicalize`).
`Canonical.toDecodable` is the obvious inclusion.

With `D = ℕ`, `toEncodable` witnesses that a `LenientEncoding` refines `Encodable G`. (There
is no `Denumerable` analogue: that needs `G` infinite, whereas cryptographic objects are
almost always finite.)
