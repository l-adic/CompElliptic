# Higher-power residues in a finite field

Mathlib covers *quadratic* residues thoroughly (`ZMod.euler_criterion`, `FiniteField.isSquare_iff`,
the `LegendreSymbol` hierarchy), but all of that hard-codes the exponent 2; there is no n'th power
analogue.

We only need the *easy* direction of the residue criterion: a single power that misses 1 certifies
a non-residue. That direction is a two-line consequence of Fermat's little theorem and needs
nothing about the structure of `Fˣ`, whereas the converse would need its cyclicity.

This is used to derive the concrete non-residue facts about the Pasta base fields in `Curves.Pasta`
(`5` is not a square, and `-5` is not a cube in either field).

/-- If `n ∣ #F - 1` and `a ^ ((#F - 1) / n) ≠ 1`, then `a` is not an `n`-th power in `F`.

An `n`-th root `x` of `a` is nonzero along with `a`, so Fermat's little theorem forces
`a ^ ((#F - 1) / n) = x ^ (n * ((#F - 1) / n)) = x ^ (#F - 1) = 1`. Contrapositively, evaluating
that one power and finding it is not `1` rules out every root at once. -/
