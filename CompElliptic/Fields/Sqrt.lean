# Computable square roots in prime fields (Tonelli–Shanks)

A *computable* square root for any odd-characteristic prime field, via the **general** Tonelli–Shanks
algorithm, parameterised by the 2-adic factorisation `card-1 = 2^twoAdicity * oddPart` (`oddPart`
odd). This is the fully general case — `twoAdicity = 1` (i.e. `p ≡ 3 mod 4`) degenerates to the
closed form `a^((p+1)/4)` with no loop iterations — not a variant specialised to `p ≡ 1 mod 16`. We
are not optimising for speed or brevity, only for correctness and computability. It is a field-level
primitive (it knows nothing about curves) and a candidate for upstreaming to CompPoly; it lives here
for now so the Pasta point decoder (`abst`) can use it.

`TonelliShanks.sqrt?` is **self-validating**: it returns `some r` only after checking `r*r = a`,
so an incorrect `TonelliShanks` instance (wrong `rootOfUnity` / `oddPart`) yields `none`, never a
wrong root. *Soundness* (`sqrt?_mul_self`: anything it returns squares to `a`) follows unconditionally
from this. *Completeness* (`sqrt?_isSome_of_isSquare`: a genuine square yields `some`) holds for a
valid instance, via Euler's criterion for the residue test and the loop invariant `loop_sound`.

The default `Monoid.npow` (`a^n`) is linear in `n`, so it cannot evaluate the `≈ 2^253`-sized
exponents here. `fpow` is square-and-multiply (logarithmic), fast enough to `#eval`.
