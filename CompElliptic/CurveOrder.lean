# Pinning a prime-order curve group's order without point-counting

For a curve whose group is *known to have prime order* r, fixing the order to exactly r needs
no point-counting algorithm (no Schoof, no proof of a counting algorithm's correctness).
It needs only:

1. a non-identity point P killed by r (so r ∣ #G, since r is prime); and
2. an upper bound on #G that leaves r (rather than some multiple ≥ 2r) as the only possible #G.

This module supplies both layers, and neither assumes any general theorem — in particular not
Hasse's theorem, which Mathlib lacks for `WeierstrassCurve`.

* **Layer 1 — pure finite-group theory.** `card_eq_of_prime_witness` holds for *any* finite
  additive group, with no reference to elliptic curves. A witness of r • P = 0 forces r ∣ #G,
  and #G < 2r then forces #G = r. `card_eq_of_prime_witness_of_lt_three_mul` reaches the same
  conclusion from the weaker #G < 3r, at the price of ruling out 2-torsion (which kills the extra
  candidate 2r by Cauchy's theorem).

* **Layer 2 — the fibre bound.** For a short-Weierstrass curve E over any finite field F, the
  equation y² = x³ + A x + B has at most two roots y for each fixed x; summing over #F choices of
  x and adding 𝒪 gives `#E(F) ≤ 2·#F + 1` (`card_le_two_mul_card_add_one`), with no arithmetic
  geometry. This overshoots the true count by a factor of about two where Hasse overshoots by only
  2√q, but it is unconditional, and it is enough whenever the prime r is close to the field size —
  exactly the situation for a prime-order cryptographic curve. Which of Layer 1's thresholds it
  clears is then decided by the two concrete numbers #F and r.

This is an application of the *Independently re-checkable trust* principle: no general theorem is
assumed, and all that a caller must discharge are closed numeric facts about #F and r, verifiable
by any independent tool.

/-! ## Layer 1: pin the order from a prime-order witness (any finite additive group) -/

/-- **The prime-order witness step.** A non-identity `P` killed by a prime `r` has `addOrderOf P`
exactly `r` (`addOrderOf_eq_prime`), so `r ∣ #G` by Lagrange.

This is the half of the argument that uses the witness, and the only half; everything downstream
just rules out the remaining multiples of `r` using an upper bound on `#G`. -/

/-- If `r` is prime, the finite additive group `G` has a non-identity element `P` killed by `r`
(`r • P = 0`), and `#G < 2r`, then `#G = r`.

The witness gives `r ∣ #G` (`dvd_natCard_of_prime_witness`); with `0 < #G < 2r` the only multiple
of `r` available is `r` itself. -/

/-- The same conclusion as `card_eq_of_prime_witness` from a weaker bound `#G < 3r`, at the price
of ruling out 2-torsion (`hOdd`).

`#G < 2r` leaves `r` as the only multiple of `r` in range; `#G < 3r` also admits `2r`. That case is
excluded by parity rather than by counting: `#G = 2r` is even, so Cauchy's theorem would supply an
element of order exactly 2, which `hOdd` forbids.

The weaker bound is what an elementary point count affords when the prime sits just below the field
size, so this is the entry point for callers who cannot reach `2r` — but the argument is pure
finite-group theory and mentions no curve. -/

`2 ≠ 0` that forces `Q.y = 0`. An on-curve point cannot then exist by hypothesis, leaving
only the sentinel `𝒪`. This discharges the `hOdd` side condition of
