# Common encoding primitives (integers, bit sequences, and endianness)

The Zcash Protocol Specification's integer / bit-sequence / octet-string conversion primitives,
shared by the concrete point and field encodings in `CompElliptic/Encodings/`. Following the
*One type per abstraction level* and *No hidden mistakes* principles: bit- and byte-sequence
depictions are distinct fixed-length types with their lengths in the types (so truncation / padding
errors are caught), and the endianness is carried *in the name* of each primitive, never a silent
default.

Every primitive in this family takes a *bit* length (never a byte length), so there is no
bit-vs-byte ambiguity to remember at a call site; an octet primitive like `I2LEOSP` produces
`⌈ℓ/8⌉` bytes from a bit length `ℓ`.

So far: `I2LEOSP` (integer → little-endian octet string). The little-endian bit-sequence
conversions (`I2LEBSP`, `LEBS2IP`) and the bit↔byte bridges (`LEBS2OSP`, `LEOS2BSP`) will join it
here as the decode direction (`abst`) is built out.

/-- `I2LEOSP ℓ n`: the little-endian octet (byte) encoding of the integer `n`, as `⌈ℓ/8⌉ = (ℓ+7)/8`
bytes, least-significant byte first (Zcash spec, "Integers, Bit Sequences, and Endianness"). Byte
`i` is `⌊n / 256^i⌋ mod 256`.

`ℓ` is a *bit* length (uniform with the rest of the family), and the domain `Fin (2^ℓ)` makes `n`
in range by construction, so there is no silent high-byte truncation (*No hidden mistakes*). -/
def I2LEOSP (ℓ : ℕ) (n : Fin (2^ℓ)) : Vector UInt8 ((ℓ + 7) / 8) :=
  Vector.ofFn (fun i : Fin ((ℓ + 7) / 8) => UInt8.ofNat (n.val / 256^(i : ℕ) % 256))

/-- `LEOS2IP S`: the integer represented in little-endian byte order by the `m`-byte string `S`
(Zcash spec, "Integers, Bit Sequences, and Endianness") — the decode-direction inverse of
`I2LEOSP` on byte-aligned lengths. The byte length `m` is carried by `S`'s type, and the result
lies in `[0, 2^(8*m))`. -/

/-- The integer `x.val + (y.val % 2)·2^k` of a compressed point encoding (an `x`-coordinate with a
single parity/sign bit at position `k`) is `< 2^(k+1)`, provided the base field modulus fits in `k`
bits (`Fact (n ≤ 2^k)`). This is the field-size precondition that lets such an integer inhabit
`Fin (2^(k+1))`, e.g. for `I2LEOSP (k+1)`. -/
